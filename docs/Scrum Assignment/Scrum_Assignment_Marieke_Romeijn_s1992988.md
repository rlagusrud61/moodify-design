**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## *Q1:* What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I prefer the role of the Teamworker. A teamworker is a good listener, they never side and they are unbiased. I am all of those things. I can never make decisions, I am a good listener and I often do not have an opinion. Teamworkers are usually positive thinkers, and I think I can say that I am a positive thinker most of the time, especially about things that take place in group settings. The weakness of a Teamworker is my weakness too, I do not like conflict and I am very good at avoiding it. I will try to not avoid all conflict situations.

## *Q2:* How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
I can be very productive when I exactly know what I have to do. When I do not have a specific task to work on, it is harder for me to begin, and then I procrastinate. I work better in groups than individually, since in a group you can not fall behind and do nothing. If my estimation of what I will do that day goes wrong, I usually will work until late at night to finish what I wanted, or I procrastinate my task. But since we work in a group, I suspect that I will try to avoid procrastinating.

## *Q3:* How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
Assignments that need to be handed in of course are most important, because I do not want to be late. Next, I will do the tasks that I promised someone from the group to do before a certain day. I tent to do the harder tasks first, so that I can do the easier/more fun tasks as a 'reward'.

## *Q4:* How do you follow the progress of your project?
To be honest, I am not the best planner. I need someone around me that makes a schedule, and then I will try to stick to that schedule. 

## *Q5:* How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
I like to first have a quick talk about where we are and what we have planned to do during the meeting. I like to work together, so that I can not get carried away by a distraction, but I am curious to see how this works during online meetings. So I like to do most of the work I have to do during meetings, and if the work that was planned to do during the meeting is not finished during a meeting, then I can finish that at home. To me it does not matter how long a meeting is, but I like to know beforehand how long the meeting is. 

## *Q6:* How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
I like to decide the requirements of the application with the whole group, in a way that every member agrees with the requirements. If all the requirements are met and the product is finished in an organised way, and we are all proud of what we made, then I am satisfied. 

## *Q7:* Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
Yes, I do think evaluation can be important for producitivity. Evaluation helps me to understand myself better and to see what I did good or where I went wrong. I always assess myself since I often get mad at myself when I procrastinated something again, so I know when I go wrong. I am not very good at assessing others since I do not want to say negative things to them. But when I see something good in a person, I like to give them a compliment right away.
