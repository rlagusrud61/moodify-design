**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## *Q1:* What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?

When I did the Belbin role test, I got the role of the complete finisher and I guess that role does fit me well. I do like going over the work and making sure that it is error-free, and I also do refine it, if required. In a team, I would like to take that role and that of making sure that everyone is in the right track. I like knowing what everyone is working on and if they need help so that tasks can be delegated if necessary and the project can go on smoothly.

## *Q2:* How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?

I would consider myself to be a very productive person. If I have any tasks I need to complete, I will make sure I finish them to the best of my capabilities. On a scale from 1-10, I would estimate my productivity to be at 9. In case I sense my productivity level lowering, I always remind myself of the end goal and I am usually able to be productive again. Most people complain about procrastinating, but I do not think that is an issue for me. I am usually always able to get myself to work when necessary and I always give it my all. 

## *Q3:* How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?

I do not have a specific criterion which I follow every time. I guess it just depends on the situation and on exactly what needs to be done. First, I usually add to my to-do list the tasks that need to be completed. Then, I consider the order in which I should complete the tasks. If there is a deadline, I try to first finish the tasks for which I have limited time and then move on to the other tasks. If there is no deadline, I simply try to think of the best way to deal with the tasks, if one task needs to be done before the other, then that is what I do. If not, I just complete the tasks in the order that I think works for me. 

## *Q4:* How do you follow the progress of your project?

Since the project for module 5 follows the scrum methodology, I will answer this question by considering the project for module 4 which also followed the scrum methodology. To follow with the progress of the project, I usually make a list of all the tasks that need to be completed before the sprint review, and in module 4, we had to use the Jira board for that. Once the list is done, I feel like it is easier to keep track of everything and it also makes it easier to split the tasks between everyone in the team. Then, I usually take the list and try to complete the tasks one by one, until I finish the tasks that are assigned to me. That allows me to keep track of the progress of the project, because I get a clear idea of what has already been done and what still needs to be done.

## *Q5:* How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?

I usually find group meetings very important because it allows me to know what everyone has been doing with regards to the project and allows us to see the progress. During group meetings, I like to be active and to ask questions regarding the project, especially if everyone was able to complete the tasks assigned to them, if any tasks need to be delegated and if anyone needs help. If all we must do is just give a report on what we have been working on and what we will work on later, I think 10-20 minutes would be enough. However, there are some tasks that must be done together and when that is the case, meetings can last up to an hour or more and I am fine with that. I find that working together helps. To have better meetings, I think having face-to-face meetings instead of online meetings would make a big different, but under the current circumstances, this is not always possible.

## *Q6:* How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?

When a project is assigned to me, I usually check what is required from me. From that, my team and I come up with the requirements for the application. The requirements are always based on what is required from us and they sometimes can contain features that the team wants. Regarding the criteria used to decide if the product is genuinely completed, I look at the minimum project requirements first to make sure that I achieved those. Once that is done, I try to refine the project and add more features if time allows. This way, I always have what is required and most of the time, I can do more than just what is required, allowing me to increase the grade I get for the project.

## *Q7:* Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 

In my opinion, a test or a series of questions is not the best way to measure productivity. I think the best way to see how everyone in the team is productive is to see how they work. By how they work I mean the time they take to complete their tasks, if they are eager to help others and if they volunteer to work on tasks. If someone in the team refuses to help others and never volunteers to work on tasks, I think it is clear that they are only productive enough to finish the tasks assigned to them and never want to take a step further.
