**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I prefer the role of plant. I like coming up with new ideas to tackle a certain issue and take part in conversations during the meetings to
see what avenues we could go down. Apart from that when it comes to my personal task I am more of a specialist focussing heavily on the 
aspects I am good at and using those to efficiently tackle my task.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
I see myself as someone who is quite productive in a team. However, I know that I am very much all or nothing. If there is just a bit of work
here and there to pick up I have a hard time getting in the flow of things and I can take longer than is necessary. On the other hand I know
that I am good at focussing on a task that takes some effort on my side and complete it efficiently.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
I do not have any specific criteria to prioritize tasks. Often in a team setting I just choose a task that I feel suits my abilities best
and that is currently a high priority and stick with that task until it is completed. My priorization comes with choosing a task but I
do not often let myself get distracted from the main task at hand.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
A decent amount of team meetings and asking other people about their progress lets me keep a decent view of the project as a whole. I like
having a list of all the tasks that need to be completed as well. I do not go into extreme detail in checking progress as I mostly assume
a task is done when someone says it is.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
I think I am decently to the point during meetings. Sometimes I can let the topic drift away somewhat but I do always make sure to have it return
to the problem/task at hand. The time I spend during meetings is completely dependent on what the planning is on the team. I will attend meetings
as they are planned. Apart from that I like to keep meetings friendly and light to keep a healthy atmosphere.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
The application will have a certain amount of functionality requirements. All functionalities should be met as a bare minimum for me. For the 
application to feel truly completed I need it to be somewhat polished and for things to be bug free and work smoothly in the back end.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
Of course, though it depends on the quality of the evaluation. Evaluation helps you reflect on yourself and others and improve on the way you work
or in a team setting the way you work with others. This helps smoothen the working progress as the project continues. I am more critical of myself
than I am of others which I believe is usual. For others, apart from the base case of having to get their assigned tasks done within reasonable time,
I mostly look at how well they work in the team and how open they are for input of others. For myself I assess to what extent I completed a task
successfully, how well I communicated the problems I had to my teammates and how well I kept moving the project forwards.
