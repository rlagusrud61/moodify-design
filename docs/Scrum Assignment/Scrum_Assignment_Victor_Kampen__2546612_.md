**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.**

##**Note from Victor: I am required to give my m-number, but I think that it is a typo and that you wanted my student number.** 

## *Q1:* What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I am often told that my vision on topics is unique and unconventional. With that in mind, I think that the role of "planter" would suit the best. I heard that
many people think themselves to be planters (so there probably is a bias here) and therefore I add that I would also be a good fit for the role of "monitor evaluator". My mathematics bachelor degree has contributed to my already strong sense of logic, and I am the most rational person my family and friends know.
I have also already proven to be impartial when we were discussing on what project to choose. Rather than vetoing the project idea I was aversed to, I said that if I was the only one opposed to the project idea we should do it anyway. My team thankfully wanted to take my opinion in significant consideration and
we came to a project idea that combined multiple ideas. We thereby created a better project of which everybody liked at least one aspect.

## *Q2:* How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
It is difficult to quantise how productive one is. I can only say of myself that I am quite productive when I'm working, but I'm prone to become overtired. So, even though I can be very productive I do need a lot of down time as well (to recuperate). I think I am productive for about 7 hours a day. If my estimation goes wrong, I usually accept it as is (and try to complete it the next day), because I did my best and after a certain while I have reached my limits.

## *Q3:* How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
Due dates often dictate part of my priorities, but also the amount of work I still have to do for a given topic/course/etc. In our project dependencies of others on my work would also help me prioritise. I do not really follow fixed criteria, but rather an estimation based on those criteria. If I'm good at something, I spend less time doing that topic/course/... so that I can spend more time on the things I'm not good at. The things I'm not as good as require more of my time, and I only have a fixed amount of hours in a week.

## *Q4:* How do you follow the progress of your project?
I measure my progress in larger but doable chunks so that I do not loose track of priorities. If I need to implement 5 functionalities, I track progress by looking at how many out of the 5 I have completed; I first focus on one, then the other, etc. If I only have to build 1 function, I look at larger subparts that need to be done.

## *Q5:* How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
During meetings I always voice concerns, add remarks, and bring alternatives and new ideas to the table. During the project I think -the others might disagree, but this is my estimation- that I'm the one that is focuses the most on productivity: Meetings can go on forever if you don't have someone that guides it. I don't know if I understand the second question, but I attend all meetings. I try to limit the hours spend at meetings by ensuring that when no new information is shared we can each go our own way. Meeting times are currently based on three sessions, but I would say that I spend 1 hr per meeting (estimation). The answer to the third question is "yes, I would like to give feedback in order to improve the meetings".

## *Q6:* How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
The requirements of our application I would base on the feeling of the product and the requirements put forth by our team in accordance with the assignment itself. If we have to design/choose our own project it means that there is not a fixed point system. The project will therefore be graded by its polishedness and complexity. Focussing on the complexity as a priority on its own paves the way for failure. Therefore I would focus on the polish of the product rather than quantifiable things such as amount of functions. I'd argue then that the product is finished if it feels clean and no reasonable functionality can be added anymore in the allotted time.

## *Q7:* Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues?
I think evaluation is key to productivity, but I think overevaluation is a real thing and could be a pit set up by the many mandatory meetings put forth by this project. I assess my teammates to be driven and willing to spend time on the project, but also as people who tend to lose focus of what is important. I assess myself as a hard and diligent worker with focus, but I know myself to be more prone to overwork myself than most other people.
