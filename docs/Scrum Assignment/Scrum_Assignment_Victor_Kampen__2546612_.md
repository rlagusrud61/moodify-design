**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## *Q1:* What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I am often told that my vision on topics is unique and unconventional. With that in mind, I think that the role of "planter" would suit the best. I heard that
many people think themselves to be planters (so there probably is a bias here) and therefore I add that I would also be a good fit for the role of "monitor evaluator". My mathematics bachelor degree has contributed to my already strong sense of logic, and I am the most rational person my family and friends know.

## *Q2:* How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
It is difficult to quantise how productive one is. I can only say of myself that I am quite productive when I'm working, but I'm prone to become overtired and so on the flip side I need a lot of down time as well (to recuperate). If my estimation goes wrong, I usually accept it as is (and try to complete it the next day), because I did my best and after a certain while I just can't continue anymore.
## *Q3:* How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
Due dates often dictate part of my priorities, but also the amount of work I still have to do for a given topic/course/etc. I do not really follow fixed criteria, but rather an estimation based on those criteria. If I'm good at something, I spend less time doing that topic/course/... so that I can spend more time on the things I'm not good at. The things I'm not as good as require more of my time, and I only have a fixed amount of hours in a week.

## *Q4:* How do you follow the progress of your project?
I write down in what session I should be according to the schedule and in what session I currently am. I measure my progress in larger but doable chunks so that I do not loose track of priorities.
## *Q5:* How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
During meetings I always voice concerns, add remarks, bring alternatives/ideas, etc., to the table. Now that the meetings are online, I cannot hear everyone properly (due to their microphone, background noice, etc.) and this hinders me a bit though. I don't know if I understand the second question, but I attend all meetings but I am the one that checks if we are still contributing to the meeting or that no new information is shared and we can each go our own way. The answer to the third question is "yes, I would like to give feedback in order to improve the meetings".
## *Q6:* How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
The requirements of our application I would base on the feeling of the product and the requirements put forth by the assignment itself. If we have to design/choose our own project, than there is not really a fixed point system. The project will therefore be graded by its polishedness and complexity. I would focus on the polish of the product rather than quantifiable things such as amount of functions. The product is therefore finished if it feels polished/clean and no reasonable functionality can be added anymore in the allotted time.
## *Q7:* Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues?
I think evaluation is key to productivity, but I think overevaluation is a real thing and could be a pit set up for us by this project. I cannot answer the second question yet since I would base my answer on two short meetings. I assess myself as a hard and diligent worker, but on a tight schedule.
