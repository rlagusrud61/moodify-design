**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## *Q1:* What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?

When I did the Belbin role test, I got the role of the complete finisher and specialist. I like learning and deep-diving into any language, api, sdk that I have to work with to know about any thing that I can use to make our project more efficient. Since I feel like this role contributes to the overall efficiency of the team and keeps the project running, I prefer having this role in a project.

## *Q2:* How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?

I am a semi-productive person, as the belbin role predicts of specialist. For instance I can have a beautiful functional code done in an hour which utilises the best methods and class hierarchy, while my peer could do the same in half. Alternatively I also focus a lot more on learning something new about the platform that is being worked on, which perhaps a lot of people skip and learn as needed, when neeed. For these reasons I find myself less productive than the max, but I would not say I am uselessly unproductive.

## *Q3:* How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?

The tasks get inversely priortized according to time I expect to finish them. Long tasks are more likely to eat through the day than those which are certain to take lesser time. Being a double major I have learnt how to time-box tasks. There is a certain time with in which I must have a work done, if that is not completed, either due to unforseen circumstances or due to inability to do so, the tasks get written down for the next free moment. Like most others I use a do-list and calendar to keep track of my work.

## *Q4:* How do you follow the progress of your project?

I follow the progress of the product by comparing to what we set out to do during the planning phase. If the look/feel of the project is widely different, this tells me we have bot made much progress, while a project closer to our drawn plan feels more complete and progress is well under way. These are not just aesthatics of the project but also the functional aspects of the project complete with their technical needs fulfilled.

## *Q5:* How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?

I am a listner in a meeting, and mostly speak up when there is a need of an interjection, and clarification or when there is a question that needs to be asked. I spend 20% of my time in meetings of the whole project, either unofficial or official and sometimes also meetings that are more technical like program code review. Do far the meetings I have experienced seem to fit what is expected of a meeting, with the necessary jabber and work balance.

## *Q6:* How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?

The requirements of the project are are decided by what I exepect a product in a similar market should allow me to do. If it is technical I want to be able to be handle the entire project using a command line option perhaps. If it has a GUIinterface, how good is it, does it allow for all options. are the settings that can be configured easy to configure. Does the program pass through many tests that I can think of, others can think of? Does the product fully realise it's functional completeness quality check? These are the questions that I ask myself when trying to anser if the product is genuinely complete, and formulate the requirements for the application accordingly.

## *Q7:* Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 

Evaluation is important but I put more stress on the type of evaluation. Evaluation can not be single dimensional, and should apply proper weaight to each factor. Everyone has their strenghts so while assessing I have to use a more tailored approach on how well do they do the what they speacialise in, and how well can they adapt in an enviornment in which they do not. Evaluation as a collective is also important which needs to be done using a more balanced approach than a tailored one, since it is expected a team should normalize any shortcomings and also strengths and a give well-rounded performance. As for link of productivity with evaluation, I would envoke the carrot and and the stick analogy, and say yes, but at the same time I would say people should not be productive for the sole reason of better evaluation.
