**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## *Q1:* What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?

The last time I have done taken the Belbin role test, I got the role of Co-ordinator. Although this role fit me pretty well, I personally feel myself closer to being a monitor evaluator. I know how to scrutinize through the project carefully and give critical feedbacks on them.  

## *Q2:* How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?

I can be very productive and focused when I'm given a task that I know I can complete. However, frankly I do have some hard times on getting started on tasks that I have no clue what I should do. If the estimation goes wrong, I usually am open about it with my teammates and ask for their help.

## *Q3:* How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?

I take the tasks that have a longer expected time of completion first. I allocate this time on my personal time table (giving a generous amount of time working on the project), and if this fails, I discuss it with my teammates on the progress.

## *Q4:* How do you follow the progress of your project?

I read the manual, and if needed, double confirm the progress with a Teaching Assistant and/or Project coordinator. 

## *Q5:* How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?

During a meeting, I try to be as honest and open as possible about any issues or obstacles I am facing (if any). I also try to give a lot of ideas for the project, and give constructive feedback on every detail. Meetings usually take longer than the allocated time, but this could be avoided by effective planning and clear organization during the meetings. 

## *Q6:* How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?

The requirements of the application will be decided based on how easy it is to use the application while fulfilling the functional requirements. My creteria to decide if the product is complete is that there shouldn't be any sense of clunkiness/awkwardness at all when using the product.

## *Q7:* Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 

Evaluation and constructive criticism is essential for any project. However, I do not believe that productivity is completely dependent on evaluations, as productivity can be increased in many other different ways, and at least from what I have experienced evaluations do not necessarily give a boost on someone's productivity. I am not particularly in favor of the sole "measurement" of someone's productivity with numbers, as numbers really do not share the entire story.
