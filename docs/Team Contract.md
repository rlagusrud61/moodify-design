## 1. Code of Conduct (Mention at least 10 Code of Conduct for your Team.)

This is expected to understand the degree of professionalism throughout the project length. It is also a kind of warning to the team members not following the conduct. 

As team members:
1. We shall always show up to meetings in time.
2. We will make sure to communicate efficiently and honestly.
3. We will try to help each other as much as possible.
4. We will split tasks equally amongst ourselves
5. We will tell each other in time when things are not going as planned. 
6. We will try our best to maintain a positive environment.
7. We will do our best to make it to every meeting.
8. We will make sure that we do not miss any project-related deadlines.
9. We will try our best to complete the tasks we undertake.
10. We will respect each other as well as help each other, if required.


## 2. Project Goals? (Mention at least 5)

1. We want to deliver a functional product at the end of the project.
2. We want to have a friendly working atmosphere and be able to communicate honestly.
3. We want to be able to learn about the Raspberry Pi and other tools while working on the project.
4. We want to be able to learn how to communicate effectively while working online.
5. We want to fulfill most of the requirements specified for the project, if not all. 


## 3. Strengths and Weaknesses (Mention at least 5)

Strengths:

1. Most of the team members are at least somewhat familiar with the programming language that we are planning to use (Java).
2. Most of the team members have worked together before so communication is usually not a problem.
3. Most members are decently flexible in their planning which allows us to assign people on a certain task if a part of the project is lagging behind.
4. We have an interdisciplinary team, with students from Physics, Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, and Technical Computer Science backgrounds.
5. Our team has a pleasant atmosphere to it.

Weaknesses:

1. We are not always to the point and this can result in longer, less-focussed meetings.
2. We are not always on time to unscheduled meetings.
3. We find it hard to follow up with information on Canvas, Zulip and the Project Manual because the information is not always the same in those platforms.
4. Because we have different study backgrounds, some of us are not fully comfortable with programming in Java or completely familiar with IT concepts and designs.
5. Most of the project members have already worked together and are therefore prone to not involve the new members of the group as much.


## 4. Team meeting ground rules (Mention at least 3)

* Keep the discussion on topic during meetings. Keeping a friendly atmosphere is important and chatting is okay but always make sure to not divert too far from the topic at hand.
* During meetings, do not let yourself get distracted. Do not check your phone for messages or spend time browsing websites. The focus is on the meeting.
* Always hear someone out who speaks up and let them finish what they have to say before you respond. Discuss calmly and let everyone who wants to speak up do so.
* Be ready to engage in the conversation. Bring up problems you may be having, weigh in on a situation if you have an opinion on it, and be ready to help team members.
* Whenever there is conflict or a decision to be made, try to find a solution that everyone can be content with. Do not settle for a solution that really does not sit well with any of the groupmates, compromise where possible.
* We communicate with each other using discord for voice chat and WhatsApp for messaging and important announcements.

## 5. Areas for Growth (Mention at least 5)

1. Some of the team members which are not that fluent in Java will learn it during the programming phase of the project.
2. We will be working with the Raspberry Pi for the first time, so there will be growth for the team members in this area.
3. We will learn to communicate effectively on different social platforms at the same time.
4. We will learn to be more effective and straight to the point during project meetings.
5. As a team we will learn to be more creative.
