## *Q1:* What are the things that went well during the last sprint? 
* We designed everything well, meaning that we actually used/implemented everything in the MVP.

* The presentation could have had more content (this has to do with what is written above).

## *Q3:* What did you learn during the last sprint on a….

### *a)* Domain specific level?
* We learned a lot about the web Bluetooth API and its libraries. We now have a concrete idea of how to implement the bluetooth functionality of our project.

### *b)* intra-personal level?
* Victor and Marieke learned that some extra TCS background would help in understanding parts of the project/goals such as but not limited to wireframing and mockups.

## *Q4:* What are your plans for the next sprint?
* HTML
* Raspberry Pi BLE
* Programming the LED and RGB with the LDR.
* Come up with a 3D sketch of what the final product will look like.

## *Q5:* Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.

| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |

| Okay  (3)                         | We did what we planned to do during this sprint, but during the presentation we saw that the other groups had made more progress, so we could have done more during this sprint. |

## *Q6:* Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?
* We appreciated Kim the most because she made the mock up and she did the presentation. She worked hard during this sprint. 

## *Q7:*  Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)
* Connectivity is fundamental to both the MVP and the final product.
* Getting the light to work via bluetooth would be a good first step.
