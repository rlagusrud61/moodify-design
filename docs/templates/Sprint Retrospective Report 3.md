| *Team ID:*       | 8               |

## *Q1:* What are the things that went well during the last sprint? 
* We all managed to finish our own tasks in time. 
* We were able to make the web interface according to the mock-up.
* Despite the worries of not being able to finish the Sprint requirements on time, we managed to complete all the necessary tasks.
* We designed everything well, meaning that we actually used/implemented everything in the MVP.
* We made significant progress from the last sprint.

## *Q2:* What are the things that could have gone better during the last sprint?
* We left all the implementation of the MVP for this sprint, which was only one week long.
* Certain people had to take on more workload than others due to time constraints as different people had knowledge on different aspects of the project.
* We did not have some hardware yet, so we could not work on some features. 
* We could have made more progress in the previous sprint to take the workload off from the next sprints. 
* The presentation could have had more content (this has to do with what is written above).

## *Q3:* What did you learn during the last sprint on a….

### *a)* Domain specific level?
* We learned a lot about the web Bluetooth API and its libraries. We now have a concrete idea of how to implement the bluetooth functionality of our project.
* We learned how to use Bluetooth to let Moodify communicate with our web interface.
* We learned how to manipulate the output of the LED using user input.
* We learned how to analyze sound data and obtain both the frequency and intensity of the input signal of a microphone.

### *b)* intra-personal level?
* We learned about where everyone's interests lie and on what tasks team member’s are comfortable working in.

## *Q4:* What are your plans for the next sprint?
* HTML:
    * Completing all the features of the web interface.
    * Ease the flow of the user interface and fix it as it was presented in the mockup.
* Programming the RGB LED with the LDR.
* Receive audio input and convert it into data that is usable for changing the light settings.

## *Q5:* Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.

| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very  Happy (5)                   |                   |
| Happy  (4)                        | We went from the mockup to the MVP. We had a web interface which actually interacted with our Moodify. Not only were we able to toggle our light on or off, but we also made it interact with the light level in the room to toggle on or off automatically. The reason that we are not very happy is because Puru took on a larger part of the work than the other team members.                  |
| Okay  (3)                         |                   |
| Sad  (2)                          |                   |
| Very  Sad (1)                     |                   |

## *Q6:* Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?
* We appreciated Puru the most because he worked very hard to make sure that the MVP was implemented in time with the required features.

## *Q7:*  Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)?
* We need to implement the music mode soon since it really adds much needed functionality to our Moodify.
* We need to add colour options. This is also needed for the music mode. We already have the light working, so now we need to figure out how to change its colours.
