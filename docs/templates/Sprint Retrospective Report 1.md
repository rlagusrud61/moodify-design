## *Q1:* What are the things that went well during the last sprint? 
* We were able to communicate very well.
* We were able to discuss what was required during the meetings.
* We were able to come up with an idea that everyone liked for the project, even though we all had different ideas at first.
* Everyone was always present during meetings.


## *Q2:* What are the things that could have gone better during the last sprint?
* Organization of work could have been better.
* We were not well aware of the deadlines.
* We could be punctual for the meetings.
* Devote more time to prepare for the presentation.
* Having a more concrete idea of what we are doing for every sprint.

## *Q3:* What did you learn during the last sprint on a….

### *a)* Domain specific level?

* Java has a library for doing Fourier transforms, which are on par with python, (perhaps not MATLAB) that are sufficient for our project.
* Finding the numerous multi functional lamps on the market and what exists and what we can do.


### *b)* intra-personal level?

* Maintaining and holding hybrid meetings.
* We need to check all three platforms (Zulip, Canvas & Project Manual) to make sure we do not miss any deadlines.

## *Q4:* What are your plans for the next sprint?

* We will get familiar with the Raspberry Pi before we start implementing our ideas. 
* Make a mock up for the Web-Interface
* Make a image or physical model of the final device
* Collate deadlines and meet them more efficiently.


## *Q5:* Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.

| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very  Happy (5)                   |                   |
| Happy  (4)                        |                   |
| Okay  (3)                         | We did not have a clear idea of what we wanted to do for the project, so it took a while to come up with a concrete idea when everyone had different ideas. We were still confused about what we wanted to do until the time of the presentation. |
| Sad  (2)                          |                   |
| Very  Sad (1)                     |                   |

## *Q6:* Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?

For this SPRINT, as a group we believe that everyone worked fairly and equally good, so we feel like it is inappropriate to nominate one specific team member who was most appreciated during the last sprint. 

## *Q7:*  Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)?

* Make a design for a user friendly web-interface for a multi-functional light.
* Having an idea how other multi-functional lamps in the current market work
* Have a concise idea for the mock-up which is concrete.
* Make sure the non-TCS participants are caught up with the some details that TCS participants covered in Module 4.
